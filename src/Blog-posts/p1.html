    <p>Expressing yourself in today's world is of utmost importance. We live in a time when the society's roots are lingered with a lot of radial issues, be it political or social. In these times of conflict, everyone must be encouraged to share their opinions in whatever way they feel comfortable, for expressing yourself is the primary way of being able to get recognised by the society.</p>

    <p>I wanted to write my blogs for quite sometime, now. After lots of procrastination, taking advantage of this quarantine season, I finally decided to learn a little bit of web development and tried to build my own platform for writing blogs. So, after learning few things, I was able to make myself this portfolio of my own using Github pages. I know it's not so good looking but atleast I've got my own platform now to express myself.</p>
    <p>Having said that, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me along the way in building this platform and with this post I begin my blogging journey. Also, it goes without saying that this page should and will see a lot of improvements along the way.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>PS: If you have suggestions for me on the topics for writing my posts or anything else, do contact me in any way you like. Thanks!</p>
